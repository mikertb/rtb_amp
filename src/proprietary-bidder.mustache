    <h2>Proprietary Bidder<br><small>And OpenRTB integration</small></h2>
    <h3>Enterprise Solution</h3>
    <p>RTBcat enjoys direct integrations with the largest suppliers of inventory, Google AdX, AOL, Microsoft, among many others.</p>
    <p>Our proprietary bidder provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extremely lean tech-requirements.</li>
        <li>Real time reporting.</li>
        <li>Near-real-time decisioning (typically).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have dubbed this a "cognitive bidder", because of its use of both supervised and un-supervised ML and <i>target at an individual cookie-level</i>.</p>
    <p>You can choose from using our deep-learning &amp; neural nets, or bring-your-own (and keep your data in-house).</p>
    <p>The usual trade-off between accuracy &amp; speed in ML is significantly improved in this next-generation of bidders. Because our tech has much a leaner set-up, we are able to process much more data in real-time. It's not always essential, but when it is, it can make a big difference to performance and efficiency.</p>

    <h3>ai</h3>
    <p>Custom-built neural networks designed to solve campaign management problems.</p>
    <p>Ever felt like your brain just couldn't handle all the potential pivots that a campaign could or should do?</p>
    <p>Ever felt bad about the missed opportunities that you see in your excel?</p>
    <p>If only you had more hands, and infinite time to build individual day-parting campaigns, Carrier-specific campaigns, banner-specific campaigns...?</p>
    <p>And all the while collect all of this data on individual impressions and visitors - to then accurately (re-)target?</p>
    <p>That is what our a.i. gives you.</p>
    <p>You can now deploy a "mind" that gives you the ability to "be everywhere" and "optimise everything". This is an extremely powerful a.i that gives the experienced campaign manager hundreds of 'sub-brains'.</p>
    <h3>On-premise ai</h3>
    <p>Need to keep your data secure, private and in-house? Use our ai on top of your on-premise CRM/1st party data.</p>
